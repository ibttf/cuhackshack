      (5-figure MRR in 9 days, 20M+ impressions).
    </p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      A 3-day invite-only hacker retreat bringing together Columbia's most
      promising undergraduate builders to see who can make the most money over a
      weekend.
      <strong>February 28 - March 2, 2025</strong> in NYC.
    </p>

    <p>
      I've met over 1,000 students at Columbia students, specifically trying to
      find builders. After hundreds of conversations, these are the best 12.
      Some examples:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>A sophomore who raised $1.5M to compete with Claude computer use</li>
      <li>2x IMO medalist</li>
      <li>
        Someone who did YC her freshman year of high school and led growth at
        the company until 7 figures ARR.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Limited spots remaining for exceptional builders.</p>

    <h2>Prizes</h2>
    <p>Current confirmed prizes (more to be announced):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>🥇 First Place: CodeCrafters VIP for Life (valued at $1,490)</li>
      <li>🥈 Second Place: CodeCrafters VIP for 2 years</li>
      <li>🥉 Third Place: CodeCrafters VIP for 1 year</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Current Status</h2>
    <p>

      this happen, DM me on

      or email <a href="mailto:churlee12@gmail.com">churlee12@gmail.com</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm looking for money for food, transportation, and prizes for the
      winners.
    </p>
    <p>Please help me make this happen.</p>
