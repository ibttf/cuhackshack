    </p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      A 3-day invite-only hacker retreat bringing together Columbia's most
      promising undergraduate builders.
      <strong>February 28 - March 2, 2025</strong> in NYC.
    </p>

    <p>
      I've met over 1,000 students at Columbia students, specifically trying to
      find builders. After hundreds of conversations, these are the best 12.
      Some examples:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>A sophomore who raised $1.5M to compete with Claude computer use</li>
      <li>2x IMO medalist</li>
      <li>
        High schooler who built viral AI chess glasses and just won Columbia's
        hackathon
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Limited spots remaining for exceptional builders.</p>

    <h2>Current Status</h2>
    <p>
      <a href="https://x.com/BainCapVC" target="_blank"
        >Bain Capital Ventures</a
      >
      has committed to sponsoring. In talks with
      <a href="https://x.com/a16z" target="_blank">a16z</a> and looking for
      additional sponsors. The more money we have, the better an experience I
      can curate.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you're building something ambitious at Columbia or want to help make
      this happen, DM me on
      <a href="https://www.x.com/im_roy_lee" target="_blank">X</a> (@im_roy_lee)
      or email <a href="mailto:churlee12@gmail.com">churlee12@gmail.com</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm looking for a space for us to crash Feb 28 - Mar 2, and sponsors for
      the builders.
    </p>
    <p>Please help me make this happen.</p>
