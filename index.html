    <h1>Hack Shack 2025</h1>

    <p>
      I'm
      <a href="https://www.x.com/im_roy_lee" target="_blank">Roy</a> (Columbia
      '27, Z Fellow). I built
      <a href="https://www.interviewcoder.co" target="_blank">Interview Coder</a
      >, cheatware for techincal interviews that hit 5-figure MRR in two weeks
      and generated 20M+ impressions across social media.

    <p>
      Columbia has a bunch of talented undergraduate builders, but they're
      scattered across campus. During my time here, me and my cofounder Neel
      have spent a lot of time looking for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      After meeting around a thousand students and talking with hundreds, we’ve
      picked 12 of the highest-signal people we’ve met for a weekend-long
      retreat: Hack Shack (inspired by
      <a href="https://hacklodge.org/" target="_blank">Hack Lodge</a>).
    </p>

    <h2>The Event</h2>
    <p>
      From <strong>February 28 to March 2, 2025</strong>, we're bringing
      together Columbia's most high-signal founders, engineers, and builders for
      an invite-only hacker retreat of deep work, collaboration, and
      friend-making.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is not a hackathon. It's a closed-room gathering of the most
      promising undergraduate builders we've met at this school.
    </p>

    <h2>Some of the people joining:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Columbia '27 student who's raised $1.5M to compete with Claude computer
        use.
      </li>
      <li>
        Columbia '25 student (valedictorian of the engineering school) building
        a Perplexity competitor.
      </li>
      <li>
        Columbia' 26 (on leave) developing a self-administered test to detect
        deadly contaminants in drinks and drugs.
      </li>
      <li>
        A high schooler (Columbia '29) who built AI-powered chess glasses that
        went super viral.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      We've already gathered an amazing group, but we might have space for one
      or two more. If you're a Columbia undergraduate working on something
      ambitious and want to build alongside Columbia's best, DM me on
      <a href="https://www.x.com/im_roy_lee" target="_blank">X</a> or find me or
      Neel on campus.
    </p>
